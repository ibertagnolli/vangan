# vangan Computational Aesthetics Using Generative Adversarial Networks 

This project was made for my High School Science fair in Spring 2020. I placed first in the computer science division and won the directors award at the University of Utah Science fair. The project is a Generative adversarial Netowrk that was trained on thousands of impressionist landscape and Van Gogh paintings I scraped from the internet. 


# Overview of the project


### Improvements Paragraph

The GAN could use a lot of improvements. I made it based off of MNIST so the images it generates are only 256 by 256. squares.

# Acknowledgements:

This was partially modified from code found online. Tutorials from towards data science, online repositories, and web scraper tutorials. I wrote this while in high school with no coding background so some of it is spaghetti code pasted from internet sources. While I have improved as a programmer I do still think this project is a good example of my ingenuity since I had never programmed anything seriou before taking on this project.
